# Weather Mood Tracker

Weather Mood Tracker is a React app that lets users track their daily mood alongside the weather at their current location. The app integrates with Firebase for authentication (including Google sign-in) and Firestore to store mood and weather data.

## Features

### Current Functionality

- **User Authentication**: 
  - Users can sign up, log in, and log out of the app.
  - Google Authentication is supported, making sign-in seamless for users with a Google account.
  
- **Weather Data Fetching**: 
  - Upon logging in, the app automatically fetches your current location‚Äôs weather data (temperature, humidity) using the user's geolocation.
  
- **Mood Tracking**: 
  - Users can select their mood using a simple mood slider (1-5 scale).
  - Moods are represented with corresponding emojis:
    - 1: üò¢ (Sad)
    - 2: üòü (Disappointed)
    - 3: üòê (Neutral)
    - 4: üòä (Happy)
    - 5: üòÅ (Very Happy)
  
- **Daily Mood Entries**: 
  - Each day, users can submit their mood alongside the weather data.
  - If a mood has already been submitted for the current day, the app will replace the existing entry with the new one, ensuring only one mood entry per day.

- **Firebase Firestore Integration**: 
  - Weather and mood data are stored in Firebase Firestore for future retrieval and analysis.

### Coming Soon

- **User Dashboard**: 
  - A dashboard where users can view their past mood entries and analyze their mood trends over time.
  
- **Mood-Weather Correlation**: 
  - Insights into how the weather might be affecting the user's mood, with visual graphs showing trends over time.
  
- **Notifications & Reminders**: 
  - Push notifications to remind users to log their daily mood.

- **Mobile Responsiveness**: 
  - Improve UI/UX for mobile devices to ensure a seamless experience across platforms.

- **Analytics & Data Visualization**: 
  - Display mood and weather trends with charts and graphs for easier tracking.
